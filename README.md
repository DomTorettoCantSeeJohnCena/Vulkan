# Vulkan API implementation

![VulkanAPI](/Resources/Branding/vulkan.png?raw=true "VulkanAPI")

Feel free to download my implementation of the Vulkan tutorial. Clone my repository by calling `git clone --recursive https://github.com/DomTorettoCantSeeJohnCena` Vulkan SDK need to be downloaded separately into a folder. After that set the new path inside dependencies.lua (IncludeDir ["VulkanSDK"] = "C: /VulkanSDK/xxxxx/Include") in the premake file and run the bash script in the script folder.

GLFW [pre-compiled binaries](https://www.glfw.org/download) possibly also need to be added.
